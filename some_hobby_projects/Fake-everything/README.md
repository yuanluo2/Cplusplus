# Fake-everything
I want to understand the principles of a software called everything, it could do file search very quickly on windows platform, so I wrote this in C++ to explorer. 

Please use a C++17 compiler to compile, and better not g++ compiler, because the .exe file generated by  g++ seems can't properly print Chinese. 

When you run the generated .exe file, admin rights is needed.

This is not for linux platform.
